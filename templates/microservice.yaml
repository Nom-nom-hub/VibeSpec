      description: "Well-defined REST/gRPC endpoints and contracts"
      requirements:
        - Define clear API contracts and data schemas
        - Implement proper HTTP status codes and responses

    - name: "Observability"
      description: "Monitoring, logging, and metrics collection"
      requirements:
        - Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
        - Provide health check and readiness endpoints

    - name: "Scalability & Reliability"
      description: "Horizontal scaling and fault tolerance"
