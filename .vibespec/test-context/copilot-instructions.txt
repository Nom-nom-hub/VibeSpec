WORKFLOW:
---------
1. Review the feature requirements carefully
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. Implement one requirement at a time
4. Write clean, well-documented code
5. Include appropriate error handling
6. Follow established project patterns

DO'S AND DON'TS:
---------------
DO:
- Implement all specified requirements
